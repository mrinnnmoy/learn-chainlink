<p>ChainLink</p>
<ul>
    <li>Chainlink  is a decentralized blockchain oracle network built on ethereum.</li>
    <li>The network is intended to be used to facilitate the transfer of tamper-proof data from off-chain sources to on-chain smart contract.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is an oracle?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Oracles are systems that can provide external data sources to ETH smart contracts.</li>
    <li>Ideally, oracles are systems that are trustless, meaning that they do not need to be trusted because they operate on decentralized principles.</li>
    <li>All oracles provide a few key functions, by definition.
        <li>Collect data from an on-chain source.</li>
        <li>Transfer the data on-chain with a signed message.</li>
        <li>Make the data available by putting it in a smart contracts's storage.</li>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Types of Oracles.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Centralised Oracles.</li>
    <li>Decentralised Oracles.</li>
</ul>

<p>Smart contract to fetch BTC price using Chinalink Oracles.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The smart contract for fetching the price is written in "demo.sol", written in remix IDE and deployed using Metamask using Sepolia test network.
